  "Hi. I'm Tony, and I love a challenge.",
  "When I lost my job as a bartender in Brooklyn due to the pandemic, I enrolled in General Assembly New York's intensive software engineering immersive program. After twelve weeks I emerged with robust training in full-stack development as well as a diverse and relevant toolbelt of programming languages and frameworks.",
  "My roles prior to development work demanded that I recognize complex patterns and details in problems in order to draw big-picture conclusions, and reassembling that information in an accessible manner for clients. This ability lended to my success as a proficient and creative coder as I began to build and deploy my first applications.",
  "Since graduating from boot camp, I've been on the lookout for my next challenge. I am constantly honing and leveling up my skillset, building personal passion projects, and engaging with the industry. Currently, I'm seeking full-time work where I can continue that growth while helping your organization reach its goals.",
